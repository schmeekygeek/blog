This book is intended for people that are interested in backend development but don't know where to start.
It assumes no prior knowledge about backend development but requires you to have some programming experience.
I have explained concepts such as TCP, JSON, HTTP, authentication and authorisation, and others to give you a strong fundamental base.

The book consists of 3 parts: The first part explains basic concepts of backend development, the second part is a brief introduction to Go, the programming language that we will be using throughout this book, and the last part is a project that we will be building together using Go.
