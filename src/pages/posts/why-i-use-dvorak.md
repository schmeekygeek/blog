# A brief history of Dvorak
[Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) is a keyboard layout which was designed by [August Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Dvorak) and his brother-in-law in the year 1936, aimed to be faster, more efficient and ergonomic than [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY).

It positions the most used keys of the english alphabet on the home-row[^1] of the keyboard, which reduces the distance the fingers need to reach to hit a key, consequently increasing speed.

In Dvorak, all the vowels are placed at the left hand's resting position, allowing for alternation, a technique where one finger or hand doesn't have to press a key repeatedly to type a sequence of characters.

# The problem with qwerty
QWERTY was supposedly designed for typewriters to solve a very specific problem â€“ to keep the types from jamming against each other. The most frequently used keys were placed apart from each other to prevent them from jamming, resulting in a very non-ergonomic and inefficient layout.
It was essentially designed to tackle a problem that no longer exists today in the modern world.

When Dvorak was introduced as an alternative, QWERTY had already cemented itself as the most popular keyboard layout, and the people, organizations, schools won't bother learning a new one because the established standard of QWERTY keyboards was good enough for their basic typing needs.

*(Try typing the word 'minimum' on your keyboard using the typical [touch-type method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), and you'll probably understand what I mean)*
