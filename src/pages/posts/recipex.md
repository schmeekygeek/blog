RecipEx is a free to use app to read recipes of your favorite dishes, aiming to provide an easy to use user-interface and pleasant reading experience.

# Credits
RecipEx uses [TheMealDB's REST api](https://themealdb.com/api) for fetching recipes based on categories, ids, and queries.

# Tech-stack
RecipEx is built using the following technologies:
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) -- A Dart framework to build fast, truly cross-platform apps with native platform capabilities.
- [Dart](https://dart.dev) -- A fast, null-safe programming language.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) -- A backend-as-a-service platform from Google for serverless functions, a database (firestore), analytics, authentication, etc.

# Why RecipEx isn't open-source
RecipEx's development started on the **6th of December, 2022**, and was originally intended to be an open-source application, but couldn't quite end up being one.
